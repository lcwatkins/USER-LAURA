** Intial structure from compute_dihedral_local
** 2nd group structure from compute_group_group

Notes/to-dos:
-- May want to change groupflags in compute_scalar fxn
-- May want to break as soon as each dihed is found, however this
   would depend on each group only specifying one interaction to
   avoid errors. Would somehow need to check this then (is there
   a group function for # of atoms included in group?)
